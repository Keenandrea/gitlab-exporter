# Exporting GitLab Metrics to Prometheus

## Overview

This guide explains different methods for exporting GitLab metrics to Prometheus for monitoring and visualization. You'll learn how to collect GitLab pipeline events and other metrics, store them in Prometheus, and visualize them in Grafana.

## Available Methods

There are several approaches to export GitLab metrics:

1. **Custom Exporter Development**
   - Write a customized exporter using GitLab API
   - Convert data into Open Metrics Format using Prometheus Client libraries
   - Provides maximum flexibility for specific metrics needs

2. **Third-Party Exporter**
   - Use `gitlab-ci-pipelines-exporter` to extract GitLab pipeline events
   - Pre-built solution with minimal setup required
   - Provides comprehensive pipeline metrics out of the box

3. **GitLab Webhooks Integration**
   - Configure GitLab webhooks to receive event notifications
   - Integrate with `gitlab-ci-pipelines-exporter` webhook feature
   - Reduces API request load on your GitLab instance

1. Monitor pipeline events using the third-party exporter `gitlab-ci-pipelines-exporter`
2. Scrape and store metrics using Prometheus
3. Visualize the collected metrics using Grafana
4. Develop a custom Python exporter to create additional metrics
   - Example: Count existing branches within monitored projects

## Metrics Reference

For detailed information about metrics provided by `gitlab-ci-pipelines-exporter`, please refer to the [official metrics documentation](https://github.com/mvisonneau/gitlab-ci-pipelines-exporter/blob/main/docs/metrics.md).

## Requirements

- GitLab instance with API access
- Prometheus server
- Grafana installation
- Docker (recommended for running exporters)
- Python (for custom exporter development)
